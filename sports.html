                    <b>1. Badminton: </b> In September 2021, I joined a Badminton Club at my school. At first I did not even know how to hold the racket or even serve but as weeks went on, I became one of the best Badminton players in the club. The thing
                    that I like to most about Badminton is placement of the Cork to score everytime you hit and this technique really boosted me in this game!
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>2. Running: </b>Long distance Running has been my passion since I was younger and up to now I still wake up every morning at 6:30 am and run about 2.5km which takes me about 9 minutes on average. Last sports day for the 1500m race,
                    I managed to become 4th place and all this is due to the painstaking practices I do every morining.
                </p>
                <p class="content">
                    <b>3. High Jump: </b>High Jump has also always facinated me and this made me do more practice and get better at it and this is obviously the reason I managed to Jump over 145 cm last sport day at our school. <b>The picture on the side is me jumping over 145 cm!</b>
