                <p class="content">I started school at Isamilo International School when I was only about 4 years old. I continued studying year after year until I completed primary education in July of 2016.</p>
                <p class="content">
                    From here I proceeded to Seconday education at Isamilo International School. In general I found secondary education as way more harder then primary education because of the fact that we have to get ourselves organised without too much guidance from the
                    teacher. Academics wise I performed incredibly well in KS3 and this was clearly reflected in the results from the lower secondary checkpoints where I did exceptionally well in Mathematics, Science and English.
                </p>
                <p class="content"> Consequently, I went on to my GCSE's the next year this was the year of the COVID-19 outbreak which really affected our whole class but all of us still managed to do extremely well in our GCSE's. Rumour has it that we got top results in
                    East Africa and this fact really impressed me.</p>
                <p class="content">Currently I am doing my A levels (year 12 and later year 13) and for me this is a very big step from IGCSEs because there are lots of topics that are completely new and the syllabus needs to be completed in such a short time. Also in A
                    levels there are many other responsiblies like managing your revision and using study periods effectively - whether it is for sport or for studies. There are some other responsibilities like being a prefect, organising events, etc.
